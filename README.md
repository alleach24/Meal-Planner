## Project Description
This meal planner is used to make a dinner schedule for your week.

### Features
- Select which days you want meals planned
- Select any ingredients you want to use up (ex. if you have leftover chicken)
- Planner accounts for a balance in meals (i.e. the meals won't all be beef)
- Account for weather when selecting cooking methods (i.e. if it's going to rain, don't provide a grilling recipe)
- 

### Potential long term ideas
- A recipe database so the app can provide the whole recipe
- A grocery list generator

### Technologies:
